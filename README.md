# FoxGooseRice
This is a word game based on the famous Software Engineer/IT job interview riddle about the Fox, the Goose, and the Bag Of Rice (or the Fox, the Duck, and the Bag or Grain).  I have designed and used this challenge to help teach people interested in learning how to code Java by using basic Java concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.  This is my solution to the challenge.  It is nowhere near perfect, but it does illustrate the core concepts for those that are still learning how to code.

## Basically, here's the problem:
*  *A farmer has three resources - a fox, a goose, and a bag of rice.  He is taking his resources to the market in town when he comes across a river which he must cross by raft, as there is no bridge in sight.  The raft can only take the farmer and one resource to the other side at any given time.  However, if the fox is left alone with the goose, the fox will eat the goose.  If the goose is left alone with the bag of rice, the goose will eat the bag of rice.  How will the farmer get all of his resources to the other side of the river, unharmed?*

## And, here's the challenge:
*  Design a simple word game that asks a player to move the farmer's resources from one side of the river to the other.
*  Use Encapsulation, Inheritnace, and Polymorphism (and any other OO concepts you have learned) to complete the challenge.
*  The solution **must abide by the rule** that the farmer can only transport one resource to the other side of the river at any time.
*  The solution **must abide by the rule** that if the fox and the goose are left alone together (without the farmer) the game ends and the player loses.
*  The solution **must abide by the rule** that if the goose and the bag of rice are left alone together (without the farmer) the game ends and the player loses.
*  The solution **must abide by the rule** that if the farmer gets all 3 resources to the opposite side of the river, the game ends and the player wins.

### That's it!  Have fun with it.
